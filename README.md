Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Minimax 

This is a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game uses the Minimax algorithms to provide an AI opponent that can play optimally, making it a challenging experience for players. The project was inspired by an older hackathon project that I completed with a partner (see TicTacToeMania repository).

How to Run: 
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to play the game. 

Algorithm Details: 
The game uses the Minimax algorithm to simulate the AI's decisions. The AI will maximize its score while minimizing the opponent's score. The algorithm explores all possible game states and chooses the optimal move based on the current board configuration.
